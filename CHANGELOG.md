# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- Contributor documentation: glossary, constitution and standards.
- Pre-commit hooks and Dependabot configuration.
- Authoring rules page (`docs/reference/authoring-rules.md`) for the rules a script cannot check and the rubric does not ask about.
- Review rubric items for category fit, Prerequisites, Related articles, the placement of "Hear it in practice", the lead paragraph, hedging, which language goes where, and layout.
- `ol validate` checks the rules below. Content that breaks one fails the check, so an author has to change it (or record it in `.ol-validate-baseline`):
  - No TODO or FIXME note in an article or index. Delete it.
  - No CEFR level and no category prefix ("Grammar:") in an article's title. Remove it from the H1.
  - No "References", "Additional reading", "Further reading" or "See also" section in an article. Move the links under Related articles, and external reading to the level index.
  - No hand-numbered headings ("## 1. Form"). Drop the number.
  - At most three links in a Prerequisites admonition. Keep the ones the article cannot be read without.
  - "Hear it in practice" is never collapsed in a dropdown. Remove the dropdown.
  - Related articles never links the article just before or after this one in its category index's toctree. Remove the link: the page footer already has it.
  - A vocabulary pack's word table has 10 to 20 words. Split or fill the pack.
  - A writing or vocabulary file name ends in a running number (`email-formal-1`, `at-the-beach-1`). Rename an unpublished article; record a published one in the baseline, because published file names never change.
